## ⚡ Fun Fact
I originally graduated as a Chemical Engineer but fell in love with coding during my first year in the "Programming for Engineers" course. Since then, I've been on a continuous learning journey. After two years of self-directed learning, I decided to formalize my career change by completing a coding bootcamp. I'm truly passionate about the intersection of technology and problem-solving, and I'm always eager to explore new possibilities in the world of software development.
